               <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
               <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, obect-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.  <span id="purple">var x;
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The  = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.  <span id="purple">var x = 10;
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span id="purple">true</span> or <span id="purple">false;</span> null - <span id="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="purple">42</span> or <span id="purple">3.14159; </span>String - <span id="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!;"</span>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or confirtions that have been met.  You can use confitional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span id="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span id="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span id="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all esssentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place th table the right way up.  Done!  We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
